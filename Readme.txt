[NLP] Text Classification
Spam Classification

*Overview
Text classification is a supervised learning problem in machine learning, because the content of the text is labeled, and is used to perform the classification.
To solve a text classification problem, we perform 4 steps:
- Data Preparation (Dataset Preparation)
- Feature Engineering
- Build Model
- Improve Model and Improve Performance

*Contents
**Theoretical issues: Multi-class problem in text classification
**Machine learning method: Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression
**Demo: Spam classification with SVM & Logistic regression & Naive Bayes & Tokenize - WordSegmentation
